### 40 pin to EPSON controller

This is an adapter that is meant to connect v7 40 pin FPC with a forward FPC cable to the 40 pin of an Epson S1D13524  controller.
Attention: This was done in a very experimental way and tested only once. Please review it to fit your specific circuit before doing any fabrication attempt!
