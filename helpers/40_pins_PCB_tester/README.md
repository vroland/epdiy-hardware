## What it is

This PCB is just a tester that comes handy if you want to check that all GPIOs, the 16 data lines plus other 7 signals, are correctly soldered in your PCB.
After this comes just need to make a easy program, put all GPIOs in an array, and sequence them HIGH/ LOW.

NOTE: This needs a 40 pin Reversed cable in order to be connected to epdiy v7

Additionally in the 2nd panel has a small MicroSD raw adapter with the pin-out since it's really cheap to have one and at the same time of doing this tester, I wanted to research a way to add MicroSD support to an epdiy PCB.
