### Epdiy V7 raw

This V7 controller iteration is based on the ESP32S3 for 8 bit panels. Highlights of the new board include:

- Support for 8-bit displays ED052TC* and 6 inches 'Kindle like' 34 pin panels
- No IO expander since we have enough pins. Plus MicroSD support to load images offline
- MPU6500 accelerometer so it can auto-detect rotation
- An optional ultra low consumption RV3032 RTC, LiPo charging
