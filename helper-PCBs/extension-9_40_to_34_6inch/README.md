## What it is

This PCB is an adapter from 9.7" (33 pins) and 40 pins (16 bit output) to 33 pins (6" output)

It can come handy if you design a PCB that has no 33 pin connector. Or also to connect two 6" epaper, that will work showing exactly the same content, to any of the controlling boards.

Design: Martin Fasani  based on @vroland work.
